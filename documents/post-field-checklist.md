# Post-field checklist

Actions to complete after every field outing

- [ ] Ensure return date is listed on lab calendar
- [ ] Write down reflections from the field:
    * Things that should be changed or updated on packing list/field protocols
    * Recorder deployments: Notes that would help locate deployments in the future (e.g., N/S side of the road, X unit will be covered by a bush by summertime)
    * Recorder returns: Locations of any lost units & any specific signs of damage
    * Difficulties accessing site (e.g., had to skip some points due to hazardous conditions)
    * Concerns about deployments (e.g., deployments too public, unit might not have been turned on properly)
- [ ] Transfer field datasheets about recorder ID/location into lab spreadsheet
    * Double check that there are no discrepancies between microSD card already listed on the spreadsheet, and microSD card noted in the field
- [ ] If used or unused recorders were brought back: check equipment in; test equipment if necessary
- [ ] If used SD cards were brought back: upload data; delete all files created after deployment END_DATE
- [ ] Transfer modified GPS points to GIS layer
- [ ] Put remaining supplies away
- [ ] Update packing list and field protocls based on brain dump; remove any deprecated tasks
