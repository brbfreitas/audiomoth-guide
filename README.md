# About the [AudioMoth Guide](https://github.com/rhine3/audiomoth-guide/blob/master/guide.md)

In the past year of using AudioMoths, our lab (the Kitzes Lab at the University of Pittsburgh) has learned quite a lot about them through trial and error. This practical guide serves as a repository for everything we've picked up about using them.


## Quick start

AudioMoths are very easy to set up out of the box. For instance:

* Purchase necessary supplies, including batteries and SD cards
* [Download](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/config) the timesetter/programming app 
* Create a program; this is explained with graphics on the [AudioMoth Config App tutorial](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/config-app-guide), and in detail in our [guide](https://github.com/rhine3/audiomoth-guide/blob/master/guide.md).
* Insert batteries and SD cards into AudioMoth
* Connect AudioMoth to computer and press green button on configuration app
* Create housings for your AudioMoths
* Devise a field protocol for deployment of the AudioMoths
* Deploy AudioMoths and put up any legally required "recording in progress" signs
